# TypeScript SDK surface

All 58 methods on `ZooworkClient`, grouped by area, signatures exactly as `src/client.ts` declares
them. The package is `@zoowork-ai/sdk` - ESM only (no CJS `require` condition, no subpath
exports), zero runtime dependencies, `engines.node >= 20`, shipping `dist/index.d.ts`, which is the
authority over anything here. `SKILL.md` has the mandatory flow; this file is for looking up a
signature, a return shape, or whether a method exists.

Twelve runtime values are exported and a test pins the list, so an import outside it fails:
`createZooworkClient`, `DEFAULT_BASE_URL`, `ZooworkError`, `SESSION_EVENT_TYPES`, `normalizeEvent`,
`isRunFinished`, `runOutcome`, `messageText`, `assistantText`, `thinkingText`, `toolCall`,
`parseSSE`. Everything else is a `type`, and there are no error-code constants - see Errors.

## Client construction

```ts
createZooworkClient(cfg: ZooworkConfig = {}): ZooworkClient   // cfg itself is optional

interface ZooworkConfig {
  apiKey?: string    // falls back to ZOOWORK_API_KEY; an empty ENV VAR counts as unset, an explicit apiKey: '' does not
  baseUrl?: string   // falls back to ZOOWORK_BASE_URL, then DEFAULT_BASE_URL (production) - leave unset unless pointing at a different deployment; trailing slashes stripped
  auth?: ZooworkAuth // { serviceToken } is deployment-internal, not available to API-key callers
  fetch?: (input: string, init?: RequestInit) => Promise<Response>  // for edge runtimes and tests
}

export type ZooworkAuth = { serviceToken: string } | { apiKey: string }
export const DEFAULT_BASE_URL = 'https://clawapi.ecap.gsmo.ai/service/v1'
```

**The SDK reads exactly two environment variables: `ZOOWORK_API_KEY` and `ZOOWORK_BASE_URL`** -
nothing else appears anywhere in the source. There is no `ZOOWORK_ORG_ID`: the gateway derives the
tenant from the key, so an org id in your environment is dead configuration. Construction **throws a
plain `Error`, not a `ZooworkError`**, when no key resolves - a missing key is a setup mistake, and
failing loudly here beats a 401 on whatever call runs first, but it does mean a `catch` narrowing on
`instanceof ZooworkError` will not match it. That guard tests `cfg.apiKey !== undefined`, not
truthiness, so an explicit `apiKey: ''` - which is what `process.env.KEY ?? ''` hands you - slips
past it and builds a client that sends an empty bearer and 401s on the first call. Only the
environment-variable path maps `''` to unset. `DEFAULT_BASE_URL` already includes the `/service/v1`
version prefix; appending another `/v1` 404s every call. An `Idempotency-Key` header is sent only
when the optional key argument is truthy (`createAgent`, `createSession`, `createSchedule`,
`createEnvironment`, `createEnvironmentVersion`, `uploadSkill`, `uploadSkillVersion`).

## Models

```ts
listModels(): Promise<ModelInfo[]>   // no arguments, no paging
```

Model ids are prefixed, e.g. `litellm/claude-sonnet-5`. Both wire shapes (a bare array or
`{ models }`) are tolerated, so you always get an array.

## Agents

A stored, versioned configuration. Create once, keep the `agent_id`, reference by id forever.

```ts
createAgent(input: { resource: AgentResource; ownership?: Ownership }, idempotencyKey?: string): Promise<AgentRecord>
listAgents(opts?: { labels?: Record<string, string>; page?: number }): Promise<AgentRecord[]>
getAgent(agentId: string): Promise<AgentRecord>
updateAgent(agentId: string, sections: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<AgentRecord>  // per-section PUT; bumps config_version on every call
deleteAgent(agentId: string): Promise<void>                     // 204; does NOT remove the agent's schedules - delete those yourself first
startAgent(agentId: string): Promise<{ warnings: string[] }>    // warnings are informational, never a failure
stopAgent(agentId: string): Promise<{ warnings: string[] }>     // does not clear environment_locked, does not remove schedules
waitUntilRunning(agentId: string, opts?: { timeoutMs?: number; intervalMs?: number; signal?: AbortSignal }): Promise<AgentRecord>
```

`ownership` can be omitted - the gateway derives your key's tenant on its own. **The create
receipt and the read projection are different documents under one `AgentRecord` type:**

| | `createAgent` (receipt) | `getAgent` / `updateAgent` (projection) |
|---|---|---|
| Config version | top-level `config_version` | `status.config_version` |
| Configuration | absent | `declared` |
| Lifecycle | absent | `status.desired_state`, `status.actual_state` |

Read the version across both as `agent.status?.config_version ?? agent.config_version`. One alone is
`undefined` on the other path, and `undefined === undefined` makes a "nothing changed" check pass
when it should not. It is no optimistic-concurrency token either: every PUT bumps it including a
no-op one, and so does attaching or detaching a skill - so a version that moved does not tell you
your own section changed.

**`updateAgent` merges per section.** `sections` is the declared config keyed by section, so sending
only `model` leaves `persona`, `labels`, `mcp` and the rest untouched. Within a section the value is
replaced, not merged, so a partial `persona` drops the docs you left out. All of `AgentResource` is
optional except `name: string`:

| Field | Type | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `model` | `{ primary: string; input?: string[]; max_tokens?: number }` | prefixed id from `listModels()`; `max_tokens` caps output per model request (omit for the platform default) |
| `persona` | `{ docs: { name: string; content: string; seed_policy?: string }[] }` | `docs` is an **array of documents**, not a filename-keyed object |
| `skills` | `{ skill_id: string; version?: number \| 'latest' }[]` | declared on the type, but no recorded create exercised it - attach with `putAgentSkill` instead |
| `labels` | `Record<string, string>` | what `listAgents({ labels })` filters on |
| `tool_policy` | `Record<string, unknown>` | reads back as `{}` in the declared config; no key names are pinned by any recorded response, so omit it |
| `mcp` | `McpServerDeclaration[]` | remote HTTP only; the server `name` must contain no underscore |
| `sandbox` | `{ scope: 'agent' \| 'session' }` | `exec` needs `agent` |
| `environment_id`, `environment_version` | `string`, `number` | pins permanently on first sandbox creation |

The onboarding interview is always skipped: the SDK sends `onboarding: false` on every create, so
the agent answers your first message directly. Ownership is likewise handled for you - the gateway
derives it from your API key, and `createAgent`'s `ownership` input is only for gateway-less
engine access.

**`listAgents` scope is `owner_uid` AND `org_id`**, both injected from your key, so an agent a
colleague created in the same org is fetchable by `getAgent(id)` and never appears in the list. An
empty list is therefore not proof the agent does not exist, and a provisioning path reasoning "not
in the list, therefore create one" mints duplicates alongside it. `labels` filters on declared
labels, sent as `label.<key>=<value>` parameters - the way to resolve your own external id back to
an agent. Page size is fixed at 100 by the engine.

**`waitUntilRunning`** defaults to `timeoutMs = 30_000`, `intervalMs = 500`, polls `getAgent`, and
returns that `AgentRecord` once `status.desired_state === 'running'`. Both failures are
**synthesized locally - the server never sends either**, which matters to any retry policy that
treats server 408s specially: a spent budget throws `408` with `type: 'timeout'`, an aborted
`signal` throws `0` with `type: 'aborted'`. Both bounds cover an in-flight poll, not just the gap
between polls, which is why this beats a hand-rolled loop - `fetch` imposes no timeout of its own in
any runtime the SDK targets, so a stalled gateway parks such a loop forever. The other reason is
`actual_state`: it reports chat-channel health, `running` is not one of its values, and an API-only
agent sits at `activating` permanently.

## Channels

Bind chat platforms (Feishu/Lark) to an API-created agent, so the same agent also answers
people in the chat app. Verified against a live deployment 2026-08-25. Requires a gateway
release still rolling out - a deployment without it answers 404 in a DIFFERENT
envelope (`{"error":{"type":"not_found"}}` instead of this family's `{"code","detail"}`),
which is how you tell "no channels here" from "not found".

**Which platforms bind, and what `config` each needs** (probed 2026-08-25):

| platform | `addChannel` | server-driven QR flow | `config` (camelCase) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `feishu` | 201 | yes — the only one here | `{appId, appSecret, domain}` when skipping the QR flow |
| `slack` | 201 | **never will** | `{botToken:'xoxb-…', appToken:'xapp-…'}` both required |
| `wecom` | 201 | not on this API yet | `{botId, secret}` both required |
| `weixin`/`wechat` | **400** `channel.weixin_setup_required` | not on this API yet | — cannot bind here |
| anything else | **400** `channel.invalid_request` | — | — |

The two "no QR flow" cells are different facts. **Slack cannot have one**: a Slack app is
created by a person on api.slack.com and its tokens only ever exist in that person's browser,
so any guided setup — including the one in the ZooWork app — ends by having them paste the same
two tokens you pass to `addChannel`. Slack therefore loses nothing here. **WeCom and WeChat do
have QR flows in the product**, just not exposed on this API; WeCom still binds via
`addChannel`, WeChat cannot be bound at all.

```ts
listChannels(agentId): Promise<AgentChannel[]>                       // [] for a pure API agent
addChannel(agentId, { platform, account?, display_name?, dm_policy?, group_policy?, allow_from?, config? }): Promise<AgentChannel>
updateChannel(agentId, platform, { account?, dm_policy?, group_policy?, enabled? }?): Promise<AgentChannel>
removeChannel(agentId, platform, { account? }?): Promise<void>       // account defaults to 'default'

startFeishuSetup(agentId, { brand?, account?, dm_policy?, group_policy? }?): Promise<FeishuSetupSession>
pollFeishuSetup(agentId, sessionId): Promise<FeishuPollResult>
cancelFeishuSetup(agentId, sessionId): Promise<void>
waitForFeishuSetup(agentId, sessionId, { timeoutMs?, signal?, onPoll? }?): Promise<FeishuPollResult>
```

The Feishu QR device flow: `startFeishuSetup` answers `{ session_id, verification_uri_complete,
expires_in, poll_interval }`. **The caller owns the UI** - render `verification_uri_complete`
(usually as a QR code), then let `waitForFeishuSetup` drive the poll loop:

```ts
const setup = await zc.startFeishuSetup(agentId)
renderQr(setup.verification_uri_complete)
const done = await zc.waitForFeishuSetup(agentId, setup.session_id, {
  timeoutMs: setup.expires_in * 1000,
})
if (done.status !== 'success') report(done.status) // 'expired' | 'denied' | 'error'
```

`waitForFeishuSetup` returns terminal statuses the server reports in the BODY
(`success | expired | denied | error`) instead of throwing - a rejection is an outcome. Treat
unknown statuses as still-in-flight. Observed defaults: `expires_in: 600`, `poll_interval: 5`.
`brand: 'lark'` really switches the URI host to `open.larksuite.com`, and must match the
workspace the person approves it in. The non-QR path is `addChannel` with the platform app's
own credentials in `config` (platform-specific keys, passed through). `allow_from` is
write-once at create - updates cannot touch it.

Seven facts that bite, all of them verified the hard way:

- **`account` names the binding, and the name is unique per USER across every agent.** One
  active binding per (owner, platform, account), so taking `feishu`/`default` on one agent
  takes it from all the others. Format is `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]{0,63}$` plus three reserved
  words (`__proto__`, `prototype`, `constructor`), and nothing is normalized - capitals or
  spaces are a `400`, not a cleanup. `'default'` is very likely already held by a binding the
  same login made in the app, which the server refuses to adopt: `409 channel.conflict`.
  `listChannels` is agent-scoped, so the SDK cannot pre-check a name - track your own. On the
  QR path the clash lands AFTER someone has scanned, leaving a freshly registered Feishu app
  behind in their workspace.

- **WeChat cannot be bound through this API.** `weixin`/`wechat` answer
  `400 channel.weixin_setup_required` telling you to use a QR flow, and that flow does not
  exist here (`/channels/weixin/setup` is a 404). Do not follow the error message.

- **`addChannel`'s `201` means STORED, not WORKING.** Credentials are NOT validated at bind
  time: deliberately bogus ones returned `201` with `health:'unknown'`/`status:'configured'`,
  then listed moments later as `health:'unhealthy'`/`status:'error'`. Never report success
  off the create call - read `health`/`status` from a follow-up `listChannels`.
- **A setup session can stop existing, and then polling 404s** with
  `channel.feishu_session_not_found` instead of reporting a terminal status. Confirmed after
  `cancelFeishuSetup`; whether natural expiry takes this path or reports `'expired'` is
  UNOBSERVED. `waitForFeishuSetup` throws there - so a caller needs a `catch`, not just a
  status switch.
- **Three distinct 404 codes.** `channel.feishu_session_not_found` (QR session gone, start a
  new one), `channel.not_found` (agent has no binding on that platform),
  `service_api.not_found` (unknown agent, or unknown action). Match the `code`, not the status.
- **A chat conversation and an API session are separate sessions with separate context.**
  Binding a channel does not let API calls read the Feishu conversation or inject into it.
- **`actual_state` starts moving once a channel is bound** - it reports that channel's
  connectivity. It is STILL not an API-readiness signal; keep gating on `desired_state`.

`addChannel` is idempotent but **not** an upsert: an identical body for the same
`platform`+`account` answers 201 again and replays the binding you already have, while the same
pair with a **changed** `config` answers `409 channel.conflict`. Rotating credentials therefore
means `removeChannel` then `addChannel` - a plain re-add fails.

`removeChannel` is **idempotent** (removing an absent binding is `200 {ok:true}`) while
`updateChannel` is **not** (`404 channel.not_found`) - that asymmetry decides whether your
cleanup path needs a `catch`. `dm_policy:'pairing'` is rejected with
`400 channel.pairing_unsupported`. `updateChannel` returns the channel in its new state, and
`enabled:false` also moves `status` to `'disabled'` and resets `health`. `deleteAgent`
best-effort disables the agent's channels; a cleanup failure never turns the delete into an
error, so unbind explicitly when a binding must die.

## Sessions

One conversation. Every session method takes `agentId` first, because the route is
`/agents/{id}/sessions/...` and there is no session handle that hides it.

```ts
createSession(
  agentId: string,
  input: { initial_events?: OutboundEvent[]; metadata?: Record<string, unknown> },  // input is required, both fields optional
                                                                                    // initial_events: only ONE user.message has been sent here - the type is wider than what is verified
  idempotencyKey?: string,
): Promise<SessionRecord>                                                          // 409 agent_not_running unless desired_state is running
getSession(agentId: string, sessionId: string, opts?: { history?: boolean; limit?: number }): Promise<SessionRecord>
listSessions(agentId: string, opts?: { page?: number }): Promise<SessionRecord[]>  // newest first, 50 per page, 1-based, no cursor
archiveSession(agentId: string, sessionId: string): Promise<{ session_id?: string; archived: boolean }>
deleteSession(agentId: string, sessionId: string): Promise<void>   // soft delete; cancels an in-flight run, keeps the transcript
```

**There is no `patchSession`, on purpose.** `PATCH` is not proxied by the gateway at all (its
catch-all registers GET/POST/PUT/DELETE), so it answers 405. Session `metadata` is write-once, at
`createSession`; mutable per-conversation state belongs in your own store keyed by `session_id`. The
run outcome is `run_status`, and it is on **both** surfaces - `listSessions` rows and `getSession`
alike, so a read already has it and needs no second call. The decoy is `status`: `null` on
`getSession`, absent from list rows entirely, and carrying `running` only on the `createSession`
receipt. Asking for `history: true` populates `history?: SessionHistoryEntry[]`, the at-rest
transcript rather than the event log - text is at `entry.message` (`{ role, content }`) on rows
whose `entry_type` is
`message`. `archiveSession` flips `archived` to `true` (the receipt is `{ session_id, archived }`,
and a later read still answers `archived: true`); afterwards writes answer `409 session_archived`
while reads keep working, so interrupt an in-flight run first or the archive races it.

## Events

`references/events-and-streaming.md` - Reading a turn covers the helpers and the reconnect loop.

```ts
postEvents(agentId: string, sessionId: string, events: OutboundEvent[]): Promise<{ events: PostEventReceipt[] }>
listEvents(agentId: string, sessionId: string, opts?: { after?: number; cursor?: string; types?: string[]; limit?: number }): Promise<SessionEvent[]>
listEventsPage(agentId: string, sessionId: string, opts?: { after?: number; cursor?: string; types?: string[]; limit?: number }): Promise<SessionEventPage>
listAllEvents(
  agentId: string,
  sessionId: string,
  opts?: { after?: number; types?: string[]; pageSize?: number },
): Promise<SessionEvent[]>
streamEvents(agentId: string, sessionId: string, opts?: { after?: number; cursor?: string; signal?: AbortSignal }): AsyncGenerator<SessionEvent>  // a generator, not a promise
```

Only four `OutboundEvent` types can be written: `user.message`, `user.interrupt`,
`user.tool_confirmation`, `system.message` - and all four echo back into the event log, so the log
alone renders the whole conversation. `postEvents` answers 202; an accepted event comes back as the
full event object (with its `seq`), and a `user.interrupt` with no run in flight comes back
`accepted: false`, a normal reply rather than an error. Give each event an `idempotency_key` so a
timeout retry converges instead of double-delivering. **`listEvents` returns one page and drops the
page's pagination fields.** `limit` defaults to 100 and caps at 500. `listEventsPage` is the same
call keeping `hasMore`/`nextCursor` (`SessionEventPage` is `{ events, hasMore?, nextCursor? }`) -
feed `nextCursor` back as `cursor` to page by hand. `listAllEvents` follows the server's cursor to
the end of the log, falling back to an `after` walk on servers without cursor pagination; both
lanes stop when the cursor fails to advance, and results are ascending by `seq`, deduplicated
across page boundaries. Passing `after` anywhere selects the deprecated engine-only lane (no echoed
inputs) - old stored cursors only.

`streamEvents` opens exactly one request and yields until the body ends. It does **not** reconnect,
retry or back off; when the server closes on idle the generator returns, and resuming is your loop
calling it again with `{ cursor }` from the last event's `cursor` token. A non-2xx response throws
a `ZooworkError` with no `type`; an abort via `opts.signal` ends the generator cleanly rather than
throwing.

## Skills

Two families: the **registry** owns skill packages org-wide, the **per-agent** methods attach one to
an agent. Attaching changes what the agent knows; there is no API to invoke a skill.

```ts
// registry
uploadSkill(
  zip: Blob | ArrayBuffer | Uint8Array,
  opts: { scope: 'org' | 'personal'; fileName?: string; description?: string; idempotencyKey?: string },  // opts is REQUIRED: scope is mandatory
): Promise<SkillRecord>
uploadSkillVersion(
  skillId: string,
  zip: Blob | ArrayBuffer | Uint8Array,
  opts?: { fileName?: string; description?: string; idempotencyKey?: string },
): Promise<SkillRecord>
listSkills(opts?: { scope?: 'org' | 'personal' | 'global' | string; q?: string; page?: number }): Promise<SkillRecord[]>
deleteSkill(skillId: string): Promise<void>   // 204, no in-use guard: agents holding it just lose it

// per agent
listAgentSkills(agentId: string, opts?: { verbose?: boolean }): Promise<AgentSkill[]>  // verbose includes ineligible/excluded entries
putAgentSkill(agentId: string, skillId: string, opts?: { enabled?: boolean; versionPin?: number | null }): Promise<{ config_version?: number; warnings?: string[] }>
deleteAgentSkill(agentId: string, skillId: string): Promise<void>
```

`uploadSkill`'s `opts` is not optional because `scope` is mandatory, and it may only be `org` or
`personal` - `global` and `pack` answer 403, published through an admin surface the gateway does not
proxy. This is the only path by which an API-key caller adds a skill an agent will load. **The zip's
single top-level directory name must equal the `name` in `SKILL.md`'s frontmatter** (compared case-
and underscore-insensitively), or the upload is a 400 reading like
`top-level directory 'my-test-skill' must match SKILL.md name 'market-research'`. So
`zip -r skill.zip market-research/` where `market-research/SKILL.md` declares
`name: market-research`; a zip whose root is the skill (`SKILL.md` at the top) is also accepted.
`SKILL.md` must be non-empty and declare both `name` and `description`. Limits: 50 MB expanded, zip
only, encrypted zips rejected.

`uploadSkillVersion` adds a version to an existing skill; the frontmatter `name` must match that
skill's name, and `description` overrides the frontmatter one. **Agents that installed the skill
unpinned follow the new version on their own** - the registry bumps their `config_version` - so a
redeploy is one upload, not an upload plus a `putAgentSkill` sweep. Only an agent pinned with
`versionPin` stays behind. `putAgentSkill` sends
`{ enabled: opts.enabled ?? true, version_pin: opts.versionPin ?? null }`, so camelCase `versionPin`
becomes snake_case on the wire and omitting `opts` means enabled and unpinned. Only skills your
tenant owns are installable: a `global` catalog entry lists fine and answers **404** here, not worth
retrying - a fresh agent already has the global catalog attached, you simply cannot control those
entries. `SkillRecord.latest_version` came back as the string `"1"` from the multipart create while
other surfaces spell it as a number; compare loosely.

## Exec and wake

```ts
exec(agentId: string, args: string[]): Promise<ExecResult>   // args is argv, NOT a shell string
wake(agentId: string, input: { text: string; mode?: 'now' | 'next-heartbeat'; deliverToUser?: boolean }): Promise<WakeResult>

interface ExecResult { exit_code: number; stdout: string; stderr: string }   // non-zero exit is still HTTP 200
interface WakeResult { mode: 'now' | 'next-heartbeat' | string; queued: boolean; triggered: boolean }
```

`exec(id, ['ls /workspace'])` looks for a binary literally named `ls /workspace`; for shell
semantics pass `['bash', '-lc', 'ls /workspace']`. **A non-zero exit is still HTTP 200** - the
promise resolves and you check `exit_code` yourself; it rejects when the call fails, not when the
command does. `cwd` is fixed to `/workspace` with no option to change it, so use absolute paths or
`cd` inside a `bash -lc` string. It requires an agent-scope sandbox and a rendered config: a
session-scope agent answers `409 exec_requires_agent_scope`, an unrendered one
`409 exec_config_not_ready`, a deployment with no sandbox backend `501 not_configured`. Default
timeout 300s; `stdout` and `stderr` are each capped at 200,000 characters. `wake` pushes a reminder
into the heartbeat queue. `next-heartbeat`, the default, only writes the pending row - nothing
consumes it unless the agent has a heartbeat configured, so on an agent without one it succeeds and
does nothing. `now` writes the row and kicks the heartbeat schedule, and is 409 when no heartbeat is
enabled; if the heartbeat is busy the kick is skipped and the row waits for the next one.
`deliverToUser: false` keeps the reminder internal to the agent's reasoning.

## Schedules

Cron-driven turns, where the read shape and the write shape are different documents.

```ts
listSchedules(agentId: string): Promise<ScheduleRecord[]>              // no opts, no paging
createSchedule(agentId: string, input: ScheduleInput, idempotencyKey?: string): Promise<ScheduleRecord>
getSchedule(agentId: string, scheduleId: string): Promise<ScheduleRecord>   // the SHORT id you chose, not record.scheduleId
updateSchedule(agentId: string, scheduleId: string, update: ScheduleUpdate): Promise<ScheduleRecord>
deleteSchedule(agentId: string, scheduleId: string): Promise<void>
triggerSchedule(agentId: string, scheduleId: string): Promise<{ schedule_name?: string; triggered: boolean }>
listScheduleRuns(agentId: string, scheduleId: string, opts?: { limit?: number }): Promise<ScheduleRun[]>  // rows GROUPED BY source, not time-sorted; limit defaults 20, caps at 100
```

**Which id to pass.** `ScheduleRecord.scheduleId` is the fully-qualified
`cron/{computer_id}/{agent_id}/{schedule_id}`; the id you chose comes back as `name` on
`getSchedule` **only**. A list row carries no `name` key at all - it puts your id at
`memo.schedule_id`, and its `schedule_name` is that same fully-qualified string, not the short one.
Every method above wants the short one - `record.scheduleId` builds a path with slashes in it and
404s. **And three responses use three vocabularies:** `createSchedule`
answers a snake_case receipt carrying only `schedule_name`, not the definition; `getSchedule`
answers a camelCase projection; `listSchedules` answers the raw scheduler describe (`spec` / `state`
/ `memo` / `next_action_times`) with that projection merged on top. Nothing comes back under the
name you sent it: the cadence you wrote as `schedule` reads back as
`scheduleSpec: { timezoneName, catchupWindowMs, cronExpressions[] }`, and
`sessionTarget: 'isolated'` as `execution: { kind: 'isolated' }`.

**A `getSchedule` result is not a legal PUT body.** `updateSchedule` discards six fields before
sending, and all six are fields a read hands you:

| Field | What the server does with it |
|---|---|
| `execution`, `originMetadata`, `contextSnapshot`, `creatorPrincipalRef` | 400, server-derived |
| `sessionTarget` | 400, immutable |
| `scheduleSpec` | **200, then silently ignored** |

All six are typed `never` in `ScheduleUpdate` so TypeScript refuses them, and the SDK strips them at
runtime so the same read-tweak-write round trip works from JavaScript too. The last row is the
expensive one: `scheduleSpec` is the only place a read puts the cadence, so echoing it back answers
200 while leaving the old cron expression in place, and every sibling field in the body applies -
the update looks like it worked. **To change the cadence send `schedule`, the input vocabulary.**
`ScheduleSpec` has three kinds (`cron`, `every`, `at`) and only `cron` has its field names pinned by
the engine reference. Cron is five fields; macros and a `CRON_TZ=` prefix are rejected, and overlap
is fixed to skip server-side, so a fire landing on a still-running one is dropped, not queued.

`createSchedule` is 409 when you re-create an existing `schedule_id` with a **different**
definition; an identical retry is accepted. PUT and DELETE carry no cross-timeout idempotency
guarantee - after a timeout, reconcile by listing and reading runs rather than blind-retrying.
**Schedules outlive their agent**: neither `stopAgent` nor `deleteAgent` removes them, so delete
them yourself first or they keep firing against a deleted agent. `triggerSchedule` returns
`triggered: true` even for a **disabled** schedule, while the run projection records
`status: "skipped"`. `triggered` means the fire was dispatched; it never means the turn ran, so read
`listScheduleRuns`. Those rows mix two shapes discriminated by `source`: `temporal` rows are
dispatch records (`scheduled_at` / `taken_at` / `workflow_id` / `temporal_run_id`) saying nothing
about the outcome, `run_projection` rows are outcome records (`fired_at` / `status` /
`consecutive_errors`). Neither carries `session_id`, so you cannot walk from a fire to the session
it created - list the agent's sessions and match `channel: 'cron'` against the `session_key` prefix
`agent:{agent_id}:cron:{schedule_id}:`.

**A cron job can carry an outcome gate.** `payload.outcome` on `ScheduleInput` (and the agent-level
default at `resource.outcome`) says what "done" looks like:

```ts
payload: {
  kind: 'agentTurn',
  message: 'Generate the weekly report.',
  outcome: {
    description: 'A non-empty report exists at /workspace/report.md.',
    evaluator: { type: 'command', command: 'test -s /workspace/report.md' },  // or { type: 'rubric', rubric: { type: 'text', text: '...' } }
    maxIterations: 3,              // 1-5
    publish: 'after_satisfied',    // | 'always' | 'never'
  },
}
```

The run evaluates, revises, and finalizes inside itself, and under the default policy nothing that
failed evaluation is announced. Stored verbatim - no defaults are injected into the stored copy,
and an unknown key anywhere inside `outcome` is a 400 naming the field, so a typo cannot silently
drop a limit. Job-level `outcome` overrides the agent default; an explicit `null` opts the job out.
Cron fires only: heartbeats and interactive sessions never evaluate. The storage round trip is
verified; an evaluated fire has not been observed yet.

## Approvals

```ts
listApprovals(agentId: string, opts?: { status?: 'pending' }): Promise<ApprovalRecord[]>  // 'pending' or omitted; any other value is rejected
resolveApproval(
  agentId: string,
  approvalId: string,
  input: { decision: ApprovalDecision; resolvedBy?: string },
): Promise<Record<string, unknown>>

export type ApprovalDecision = 'allow-once' | 'allow-always' | 'deny'
```

Because `status` may only be omitted or `'pending'`, resolved approvals cannot be listed - record
decisions yourself if you need an audit trail. Where no approval signaler is configured the route
answers `501 not_configured`, a deployment property your code cannot fix. Two shapes describe the
same act and do not line up - this REST resource, and the `user.tool_confirmation` event you write
with `postEvents`. They are not two views of one object, so do not correlate an `approval_id` with a
tool-call id. **The loop has never been closed end to end:** the only observation is a 200 with an
empty `approvals` array, so `ApprovalRecord`'s field names are unverified. Do not build on it, and
note that a run parked on an approval burns its whole turn budget waiting. The reasoning, and what
to do instead, is in `references/not-supported.md` - Approvals.

## System prompt

```ts
getSystemPrompt(agentId: string): Promise<SystemPromptInfo>
previewSystemPrompt(agentId: string, input: SystemPromptPreviewInput): Promise<SystemPromptPreview>
upgradeSystemPrompt(
  agentId: string,
  input: { expected_config_version: number; template_version?: number },
): Promise<SystemPromptUpgrade>

export type SystemPromptDeclaration =
  | { source: 'platform'; version: number }
  | { source: 'custom'; base_version: number; template: string }
```

A fresh create pins the platform template version active at that moment - the declaration reads
back as `{ source: 'platform', version: N }` - and the pin **never follows a later platform
activation on its own**: ordinary PUTs, skill changes and rerenders keep it. Moving it is
exactly one call, `upgradeSystemPrompt`: `expected_config_version` is a required CAS (stale
answers `409 config_version_changed` - read the projection fresh, then upgrade), omitting
`template_version` upgrades to the currently active platform version, and the 200 receipt
carries the NEW `config_version` because an upgrade is a config write like any other. It needs
a gateway with fix #3387 (2026-08-14); an older deployment answers a gateway 404 on this
route's `{id}:verb` grammar. On PUT the `system_prompt` section is replace-on-write, like
`tool_policy`, not merged. `previewSystemPrompt` assembles the exact prompt for runtime facts
you supply without touching any session (deterministic, `transcript` always `[]`, one hash per
template slot in `slot_hashes`); its `config_version` must be the agent's **current** one or
the answer is `409 config_version_changed`.

## Artifacts

```ts
listArtifacts(agentId: string, opts?: { page?: number; limit?: number; sessionId?: string; sourcePath?: string; createdBefore?: string }): Promise<ArtifactPage>
getArtifact(agentId: string, artifactId: string): Promise<ArtifactRecord>
downloadArtifact(agentId: string, artifactId: string): Promise<{ artifact_id?: string; url?: string }>  // 409 artifact_not_ready before finalization
deleteArtifact(agentId: string, artifactId: string): Promise<ArtifactRecord>
```

Artifacts are published by the agent's own in-loop `artifact_publish` tool during a turn; there is
**no API to publish one from your code** - these methods manage what the agent produced. Every
artifact route demands `owner_uid`+`org_id` query selectors that the gateway does not inject; the
SDK derives both from the agent's own projection and caches them per agent, so the first artifact
call on an agent costs one extra GET - do not add the selectors yourself. `listArtifacts` returns
the page verbatim (`{ artifacts, page, has_more }`): unlike `listEvents`, **this list tells you
when it truncated** - read `has_more`. The access `url` is a revocable bearer capability; treat it
as a secret and re-mint with `downloadArtifact` rather than storing it long-term.

## Environments

A versioned sandbox image. Optional - a fresh agent is already pinned to a platform default - and
the pin locks permanently on first sandbox creation.

```ts
listEnvironments(opts?: { page?: number }): Promise<EnvironmentRecord[]>   // 1-based; the platform default is not in here
getEnvironment(environmentId: string): Promise<EnvironmentRecord>          // 404 outside your org, incl. the platform default
createEnvironment(
  input: { resource: EnvironmentResource; ownership: Ownership },
  idempotencyKey?: string,
): Promise<EnvironmentRecord>
archiveEnvironment(environmentId: string): Promise<EnvironmentRecord>
createEnvironmentVersion(
  environmentId: string,
  config: EnvironmentConfig,     // a bare config; the SDK wraps it as { resource: { config } }
  idempotencyKey?: string,
): Promise<EnvironmentVersionRecord>
getEnvironmentVersion(environmentId: string, version: number): Promise<EnvironmentVersionRecord>

// resource.config accepts EXACTLY these four keys; anything else is 400 invalid_environment_config,
// which is why EnvironmentConfig has no index signature and a stray key is a compile error.
interface EnvironmentConfig {
  packages?: { apt?: string[]; npm?: string[]; pip?: string[] }   // install order is fixed apt -> npm -> pip
  files?: { path?: string; contentBase64?: string; upload_id?: string; executable?: boolean }[]
  build?: { script?: string; verify_script?: string }
  networking?: { type: 'unrestricted' | 'limited'; allowed_hosts?: string[] }  // omitted means unrestricted
}
```

Files land under `/opt/zooclaw/environment/`, and a top-level `bin/*` marked executable is linked
into `/usr/local/bin`. No user-defined secrets, env vars, or start hooks (the platform injects
its own runtime credentials for built-in skills; that layer is internal and not extensible). **Poll
`getEnvironmentVersion` and read `status`, not `state`**: there is no `state` field on a version, so
a loop written against one compares `undefined` to `'ready'` forever and never terminates. Builds
walk `queued -> submitting -> building -> verifying -> ready`, and any phase can land in `failed`
(`failure_stage` and `failure_message` say which). Pin only a `ready` version, or `createAgent`
answers `409 environment_not_ready`. On the Environment row, `latest_version` is the newest version
**created** - `1` the instant you create an Environment, while that version is still `queued` - and
`latest_ready_version` is the newest one that finished building, `null` until a build lands. **Pin
`latest_ready_version`.** `archiveEnvironment` exists mainly to get one character right: the route
is `POST /environments/{id}:archive`, and a raw `:` makes the engine miss the route and answer 404.
The SDK sends `%3A` for you; from another language, encode it yourself. `createEnvironmentVersion`
also reaches a real route, but its request body was never exercised against a live deployment - the
SDK sends `{ resource: { config } }`, mirroring create, on that symmetry alone, so verify before
depending on it. Versions are immutable: a retry after a failed build retries that version and keeps
its attempt log.

## Credentials

There is no credential API on the client: the gateway seeds model credentials itself at create, so
there is nothing for an API-key caller to store. One consequence: `McpServerDeclaration.credential`
names a credential slug that is accepted and stored on the agent, but there is no endpoint to put
the secret it points at, so an authenticated MCP server cannot be made to work - declare public
servers only. See `references/not-supported.md` - Credentials and vaults.

## Errors

```ts
export class ZooworkError extends Error {
  status: number
  type?: string      // absent, not undefined-valued, when the server sent no code
  constructor(status: number, message: string, type?: string)
}
```

`this.name` is `'ZooworkError'` and the class is a runtime export, so `instanceof` works; the one
failure that is **not** a `ZooworkError` is the missing-key throw from `createZooworkClient`.
**There are two error vocabularies, because there are two envelopes.** The SDK unpacks both into the
same class, but the spelling differs by family:

| Family | Envelope | `type` looks like |
|---|---|---|
| sessions, schedules, environments | `{ error: { type, message } }` | bare: `agent_not_running`, `session_archived`, `environment_not_ready` |
| agents | `{ code, detail }` | dotted: `service_api.not_found` |

The message falls back through `error.message` -> `message` -> `detail` -> `HTTP <status>`; a
non-JSON error body leaves `type` absent. **No error-code constants are exported** - `type` is a
bare `string | undefined`, with no enum, union or const array anywhere in the package. You compare
against string literals you write yourself, which is why you should **match on `status` when you
only need the class of failure** and reach for `type` only to tell two failures with the same status
apart. Never match on message text: it is prose, it is not stable, and the same condition reaches
you differently worded depending on which envelope answered. Two more things a `catch` should
expect: a cross-tenant or unknown id answers **404, not 403**, so a 404 does not mean deleted; and
two errors never came from a server at all - `waitUntilRunning`'s `408 timeout` and `0 aborted`.
`streamEvents`' stream-open failure is a third `ZooworkError` you did not get from an error
envelope, but it does carry the response's real status, with an SDK-written message and no `type`.
